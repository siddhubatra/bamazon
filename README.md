# Bamazon: An Amazon Clone

## What problem does the app solve?

This Command Line Interface app displays the stock of a makeshift 'Amazon' store, and allows to buy something.

## App Organization

The app utilizes the inquirer module to interact with the user and a sql module to display the table. Formatting the table is done through the columnify module.

## How to run the app

You can run the app by typing in ``node liri.js bamazon-customer.js``.

### Video of the working app is right here:

Of course, Node.js was used, along with the mysql, inquirer, and mysql libraries.
